\item[]{\textbf{Isolation:} The property that defines the visibility of transaction changes to other transactions.}
\item[]{\textbf{Durability:} Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so even after a system failure.}
\item[]{\textbf{ACID}: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability}
\item[]{\textbf{Isolation Levels:} Defines the degree of isolation between transactions, impacting concurrency and consistency.}
