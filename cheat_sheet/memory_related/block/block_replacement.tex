\subsection*{Block Replacement Policies}
\vspace{-0.1cm}

\noindent
Block replacement policies are techniques used in cache management. When the cache is full, and a new block needs to be loaded, these policies decide which existing block to replace.

\noindent
\textbf{FIFO (First-In-First-Out)}: The oldest block in the cache is replaced first.
Simple to understand and implement.
May not always remove the least useful block, leading to suboptimal cache performance.

\noindent
\textbf{LRU (Least Recently Used)}: Replaces the block that has been unused for the longest time.
More effective than FIFO in many scenarios as it considers the recent usage pattern.
Implementation can be more complex and resource-intensive than FIFO, as it requires tracking the usage history of each block.
